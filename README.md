# Containerized App Exercise

## Project Description
This project aims to create a user-friendly web application that utilizes machine learning to detect emotions through a webcam. The application, containerized using Docker for ease of deployment, employs Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Users grant webcam access, and upon clicking the "Capture" button, the system analyzes their emotion. Depending on the detected emotion, users are dynamically redirected to corresponding emotion-themed pages. The project showcases the integration of machine learning in a web application, offers a responsive UI, and can be deployed on various platforms using Docker containers, making it a versatile and engaging prototype for emotion-aware applications. 

- two badges at the top of the README.md file showing the result of the latest build/test workflow of the server both the machine learning client and web app subsystems.
